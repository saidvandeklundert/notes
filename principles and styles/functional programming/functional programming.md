## Functional programming

In functional programming, the aim is to write 'pure functions'. A pure function is a function that does not have any side-effects. The function has (optional) parameters and returns an output. Nothing else outside of the function has its state altered in any way.

A higher order function is a function that:
- gets another argument as a function and/or
- returns a function as a result

Closure:
- We have a nested function (funcion defined inside a function)
- the nested function refers to a value defined in the enclosing function.
- the enclosing function returns the nested function
