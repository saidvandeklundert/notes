If an interviewer asks:

"Do you work well under pressure?"

Ask them:

"What does high pressure look like in this role? And how is that pressure built?

It's going to be one of three things;

1) You are in the wrong interview and somehow walked into an interview for a Nursing position, or to be a Firefighter. Walk away slowly and apologise.
2) The pressure is fabricated through urgency as a result of poor management and psychological danger of saying 'no'.
3) The role deals with constant production incidents, putting out constant fires, high staff turnover and you are going to need to find a way of making that better.
