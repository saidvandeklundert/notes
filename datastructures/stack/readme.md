The stack is an ordered collection where items are added and removed from the top. Stacks are LIFO and considered a linear data structure.

Common methods include:
- stack(): create a new stack
- push(): store an item on top of the stack
- pop(): return and remove the top value
- peek(): look at, but do not remove, the top value
- is_empty(): tells you if the stack is empty
- size(): show the number of items on the stack
