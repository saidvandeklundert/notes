Great docs: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/

What they say Pydantic is:

```
Data validation and settings management using python type annotations.

pydantic enforces type hints at runtime, and provides user friendly errors when data is invalid.

Define how data should be in pure, canonical python; validate it with pydantic.
```

Has an interest in Rust, will he replace the core of Pydantic with Rust? Would be awesome!
