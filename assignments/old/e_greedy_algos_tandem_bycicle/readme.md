Tandems operate at the speed of the fastes person.

You get 2 lists of riders, one wearing blue shirts and one wearing red shirts.
The number in the list is their speed.

You need to pair the riders in such a way that you get the maximum possible total speed (if fastest = True) OR the minimum possible speed (if fastest = Fase).

The total speed is the sum of the speeds of all tandem bycicles being ridden.

Example:
```
redShirtSpeeds = [5, 5, 3, 9, 2]
blueShirtSpeeds = [3, 6, 7, 2, 1]
fastest = True
```


Output 32


Optimally, this is in O(nlg(n)) time and O(1) space
