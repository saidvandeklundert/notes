Write a func that takes in a non-empty array and returns the max sum that can be obtained by summing up all of the integers in a non-empty subarry of the input array.

The subarray must only contain adjacent numbers.

Example input:
```
[1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -9, 6, 3, 1]
```

Example output:
```
19 // [1, 3, -2, 3, 4, 7, 2, -9, 6, 3, 1]
```
