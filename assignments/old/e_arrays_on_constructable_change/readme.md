Write a func that returns the minimum amount of change that you CANNOT create.

The given coins can have any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique.

Example:
```
[1,2,5]
```
Minimum amout of change that you cannot create is 4.

If you have no coins, the minimum amount of change that you cannot create is 1.

Another example:
```
[ 5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]
```

Output:
20

Optimal solution:

O(Nlogn) time O(1) space
