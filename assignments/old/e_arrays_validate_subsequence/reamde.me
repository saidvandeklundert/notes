given 2 non-empty arrays, write a func that determines if the second array is a subsequence of the first array.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that are not necesarily adjacent. So [1,3,4] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4].

Example input:

array: [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence: [1, 6, -1, 10]

Output:
True

It can be done in O(n) time and O(1) space.
