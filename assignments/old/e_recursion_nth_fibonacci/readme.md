Write a function that takes a number n and returns the n-th fibonacci number.

Fibonacci numbers form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence. This sequence is such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1

A Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
0
0,1
0, 1, 1
0, 1, 1, 2
0, 1, 1, 2, 3
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
...
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,

Optimally, this is 
O(n) time and O(n) space where n is the input number
