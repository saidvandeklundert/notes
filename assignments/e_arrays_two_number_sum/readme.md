The function takes a non-empty array of integers and an integer that specifies the target sum:
```
{
  "array": [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6],
  "targetSum": 10
}
{
  "array": [4, 6, 1],
  "targetSum": 5
}
```

The goal is to find the two numbers in the aray that add up to the target sum and return those numbers in an array in any order.

If there are no numbers that can be used to create targetsum, then return an empty array.

Do it in O(n) time and O(n) space.
