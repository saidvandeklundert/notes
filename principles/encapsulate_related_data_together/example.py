"""
Sometimes different pieces of data are inescapably related to 
one another and a piece of code needs to to pass them around.

In this scenario, it often makes sense to group them together in a class (or similar structure).

Doing this allows code to deal with the higher level concept that the
group of items represent rather than always having to deal with the 
nuts-and-bolts details. This can make the code more modular and
 keep changes in requirements more isolated.
